# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

Objective: To develop and evaluate an ML model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

Data Preprocessing: The data was carefully cleaned and preprocessed to handle any missing values, normalize features, and address the class imbalance through techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, etc.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analyses were conducted to understand the distribution and relationships of the features.

Model Selection: Several machine learning models were tested, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines.

Model Evaluation: Models were evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation is also used to ensure the robustness of the working models.

Results: The final model achieved high accuracy and recall, successfully identifying a significant portion of fraudulent transactions while maintaining a low false positive rate.

Conclusion: The project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in detecting credit card fraud and highlighted the importance of feature engineering and handling class imbalances.
